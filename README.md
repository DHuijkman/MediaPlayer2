# MediaPlayer2
simple media player

This is a simple mediaplayer i made for android while teaching myself some stuff about working in android studio.
Some of its Functions are:

	1 automaticaly detecting mp3 files and adding them into a playlist
	2 skip to the previous and next song
	3 go forward and backwards per 5sec increments
	4 play and pause (duh :P)
	5 a slider that shows you how far the song has progressed and also allows you to fast forward/backward 
    by dragging the pointer(simple seekbar)
    
    update 02-09-2018
    	music controller updated now with a display for the currently playing title song, a replay toggle button,
    	a autoplay mode, and time display of the elapsed time and song duration.
	
		minor bugs fixed where threads wouldnt close after selecting a new song and the app is now forced in portrait mode
		for now.
  
More stuff might come in the future it just depends on how much time i have and if something fun pops up. 
I wont say that the code is perfect. Im using this myself to learn more about designing apps
but so far it works without bugs or crashing. Have fun with it .//
